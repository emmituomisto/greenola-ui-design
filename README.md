This UI/UX design was created as part of the **Designing Digital Service** course at **LAB University of Applied Sciences**. The course focused on designing digital solutions for the city of Heinola, that enhance user experience and provide value. The project was **not officially shared with Heinola city or any external organization**—it was purely an academic exercise.

💜 **Recycling guides** to educate users on proper waste management  
💜 **Local eco-friendly business listings** to support sustainability  
💜 **Finding the closest recycling point using a map** for convenience

1️⃣ **Research & Analysis** – Understanding user needs, sustainability goals, and existing digital solutions  
2️⃣ **Service Design & Concept Development** – Defining the core functionalities and structuring the user journey  
3️⃣ **UI/UX Design & Prototyping** – Designing and creating an interactive **Figma prototype**  
4️⃣ **Presentation & Documentation** – Compiling findings and presenting the final concept
